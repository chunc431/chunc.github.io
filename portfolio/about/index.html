          <h1>
              My passion comes from the problem-solving process of design, the creative buzzüêù from digging through a new project, and getting design inspiration from everything around me. During my time at Parsons School of Design, I have experimented with designing posters, websites, brand logos, product packaging, and many more. Through my work, I have gained advanced skills in Adobe Creative Suite, Github, and additional design applications to bring my ideas to reality.
          </h1>
          <h2>
              As a young designer, I love to look at the world from a different perspective, constantly looking for new challenges and ways to create. I seek to be a part of a creative community that is on the frontlines of innovation and encourages me to reimagine the impossible as possible.
          </h2>
          <h3>
              Outside of work, I like to watch moviesüé• and listen to musicüéß. I was born and raised in New Jersey and later moved to NYC where I currently attend Parsons School of Design.
